# Package Placeholder

## What is this?

The Pins Team reserved this package name for future use. If you like to claim this, please create an new issue on [GitHub]/[GitLab]
or see the [package name dispute policy](https://npmjs.com/policies/disputes) for details to how you can contact us thru email.

We release it once we think we don't need that package name in the future, otherwise we may asked to contribute to our unreleased
projects that are open-source from day 1 instead.

## Why you reserved this name?

Too many reasons. If you want to ask that, take that to our issue trackers linked above.
